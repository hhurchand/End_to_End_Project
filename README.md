SPAM VS HAM | INTEGRATIVE PROJECT


THE  OBJECTIVE

BUILD A TEXT CLASSIFICATION PIPELINE TO DETECT WHETHER AN EMAIL IS SPAM OR HAM USING MULTIPLE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS.


THE PROJECT STRUCTURE

DATA, SRC, OUTPUTS, AND REPORTS ARE ORGANIZED TO ENSURE A CLEAN AND MODULAR PIPELINE.

ALL MODELS, METRICS, AND LOGS ARE AUTOMATICALLY SAVED FOR REPRODUCIBILITY.


THE PIPELINE OVERVIEW

DATA CLEANING : REMOVE DUPLICATES, STANDARDIZE TEXT, UPPERCASE, PUNCTUATION, STOPWORDS.

TRAIN - TEST SPLIT : SEPARATE DATA FOR VALIDATION.

TF-IDF VECTORIZATION : CONVERT TEXT TO NUMERIC FEATURES.

MODEL TRAINING | RUN THREE MODELS:
.A. NAIVE BAYES
.B. LOGISTIC REGRESSION
.C. LINEAR SVM

MODEL EVALUATION : GENERATE CONFUSION MATRIX, ACCURACY, F1-SCORE.
MODEL SAVING : SAVE TRAINED MODELS AS .PKL FILES IN OUTPUTS.

REPORTING :  MLFLOW LOGGING AND SUMMARY REPORT GENERATED.


PERFORMANCE METRICS RESULTS

   MODEL	          ACCURACY	  F1-SCORE

NAIVE BAYES	           0.9195      0.9074
LOGISTIC REGRESSION	   0.943	   0.9396
LINEAR SVM	           0.9664      0.9642


STREAMLIT APPLICATION

RUN THE APP LOCALLY TO TEST EMAILS IN REAL TIME.
TYPE OR PASTE AN EMAIL MESSAGE VIEW THE PREDICTION, IF A SPAM OR A HAM

THE APP ALSO DISPLAYS A SIGMOID MARGIN CURVE AND A CONFIDENCE BAR TO VISUALIZE HOW 
CERTAIN THE MODEL IS ABOUT ITS DECISION.

THE SIGMOID CURVE CONVERTS THE MODEL’S RAW SCORE | THE MARGIN INTO A PROBABILITY VALUE BETWEEN 0 AND 1.

WHEN THE POINT IS NEAR THE CENTER AROUND 0, THE MODEL IS UNSURE — CONFIDENCE IS CLOSE TO 50%.

AS THE POINT MOVES TO LARGER POSITIVES, THE PROBABILITY APPROACHES 1.0 - HIGH CONFIDENCE FOR SPAM.

AS THE POINT MOVES TOWARD LARGER NEGATIVES, THE PROBABILITY APPROACHES 0.0 - HIGH CONFIDENCE FOR HAM.


THE CONFIDENCE BAR BELOW THE GRAPH SHOWS THIS SAME VALUE AS A PERCENTAGE.
