    description='The SMS Spam dataset is a collection of text messages labeled as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam" (unwanted or promotional). It is commonly used to build and evaluate machine learning models for text classification. To predict whether a message is spam, we can use a simple model that first converts the text into numerical features using techniques, then trains a model. Once trained, the model can analyze new messages and classify them as spam or not based on learned patterns in the text.',
